# os

this is an x86 operating system (bootloader and kernel) made with the main purpose of learning how operating systems work.
i wrote it in assembly but i would like to make a programming language to go along with the OS once it's self-hosted, if i get to that point.

specs-wise i'm not totally sure what you'd need but for reference i'm testing it on Lenovo Thinkpad S540 with an Intel CPU.
i've only tested booting off of USB but hopefully other boot methods would work too (with maybe a little change to the MBR partition table).
